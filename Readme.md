Yes — let's walk through how to design and architect your automation product step by step.

🧠 Assumption:
You're building an automation product (e.g., for smart file management, daily routine automation, or productivity tasks). I'll go with a "Smart Desktop File Automation Tool" as the base example, but you can adapt this to your specific idea.

🧩 1. Define the Core Problem & Features
🔧 Problem:
People waste time organizing or interacting with repetitive files/tasks on their computer.

🎯 Core Features:
Rule-based automation (e.g., "Move all PDFs larger than 10MB to /Documents/PDFs").

File type recognition (e.g., detect images, docs, videos).

GUI + CLI interface.

Scheduled background automation.

Log/report of what actions were taken.

Support for multiple platforms (Windows/Linux/Mac in roadmap).

📦 3. Component Breakdown
Component	Description
GUI	PyQt/Tkinter-based interface to add rules and schedule actions
CLI Interface	Python CLI (Click or argparse) for power users
Rule Engine	Evaluates filters: file size, type, name, date, etc.
Filesystem Scanner	Scans given directory tree and matches files against rules
Action Module	Executes operations: move, copy, delete, rename
Scheduler	Periodic runs using cron (Linux/mac) or Task Scheduler (Windows)
Report Logger	Saves logs to file or dashboard (HTML/JSON/CSV)

🧪 4. Tech Stack
Layer	Tech
GUI	PyQt6 or Electron (later)
CLI	Python + Click/argparse
Core Logic	Python
Scheduler	Cron/Windows Task Scheduler
Database (optional)	SQLite for storing rules
Packaging	PyInstaller / auto-updater

📄 5. Example User Rule (DSL or JSON)

{
  "rule_name": "Move big PDFs",
  "conditions": {
    "type": "pdf",
    "size_greater_than_mb": 10
  },
  "action": {
    "move_to": "/Documents/BigPDFs"
  }
}
🔁 6. Basic Workflow
User creates a rule (GUI or CLI)

Rule is saved to a config file or DB

Scheduler or user runs the scan

Files matching rule are moved/copied/renamed

A log is written
